# Google FrontEnd Clone

This is the sixth assignment given in Python 2023 : 100 Day Programming Camp.
 
In this assignment, the frontends of the "https://www.google.com.tr/" and "https://www.google.com.tr/imghp" pages were cloned with the same views. "Search on google" and "I'm feeling lucky" buttons were made according to their operations.
